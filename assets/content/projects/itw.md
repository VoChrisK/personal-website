title: 'Interactive Twelvefold Way'
description: 'An interactive visualization that lets users experiment and practice on the Twelvefold Way, a systematic classification of twelve formulas relating to two finite sets in Combinatorics. It leverages the balls-and-bins and stars-and-bars models to visualize how each formula function under the hood. This project was built with object-oriented principles and user experience in mind.'
