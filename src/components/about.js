        <p className="description">When I was thirteen years old, I was introduced to programming through <strong className="bold">ROBLOX</strong>, a massively-multiplayer online video game and game creation platform. By immersing myself in game development and programming with Lua, I was able to develop a game that was fairly popular at the time: <strong className="bold">Amusement BLOX</strong>. This game is an amusement park with a variety of rides and minigames and it was played by users over 50,000 times. It was this moment where I became interested in software engineering.</p>

        <p className="description">Fast forward to present time, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics at <strong className="bold">San Jose State University</strong>, and completed a full stack web development bootcamp: <strong className="bold">App Academy</strong>. I enjoy building new things and solving logical problems programatically. I also enjoy working collaboratively with other engineers to develop solutions for universal problems. Most importantly, I enjoy learning new things, whether it's related to this field or my hobbies! I am currently in a team in <strong className="bold">Fidelity Investments</strong> where I work on projects using Angular and Node.js.</p>
